# Problem Statement
Amazon Connect is a publicly available cloud contact center within AWS. Amazon Connect Supervisors currently lack the ability to view recordings of call center agent interactions with the customers of their businesses. This shortcoming can result in customer dissatisfaction, unmet compliance objectives, and inadequate training for new employees. Our project aims to develop a full-stack solution that allows for Contact Center Supervisors to search and browse Amazon Connect Agent Screen Recordings. Supervisors having access to these recordings can lead to an increase in quality of customer experience and improved training for new agents.
